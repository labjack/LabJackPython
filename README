Python 2.5 or higher is required to use LabJackPython. Python 3.x is not
supported.

To use Modbus first check that your LabJack device meets the minimum required
firmware version listed on this page:

    http://labjack.com/support/modbus

To upgrade firmware look at this page:

    http://labjack.com/support/firmware

To use Modbus on a UE9 over Ethernet, install Comm firmware 1.50 or higher:

    http://labjack.com/support/firmware/ue9

To install LabJackPython, run the following command in a terminal:

    $ sudo python setup.py install

(Leave off the `sudo' on Windows.)
    
From there, interacting with your devices is easy.

For U3:
>>> import u3
>>> d = u3.U3()
>>> d.configU3()
{'BootloaderVersion': '0.27',
 'CIODirection': 0,
 ...,
}
>>> d.close()

For U6:
>>> import u6
>>> d = u6.U6()
>>> d.configU6()
{'BootloaderVersion': '6.15',
 'FirmwareVersion': '0.88',
 ..., 
}
>>> d.close()

For UE9:
>>> import ue9
>>> d = ue9.UE9()
>>> d.commConfig()
{'IPAddress' : '192.168.1.209'
 ...,
}
>>> d.close()

For U12:
>>> import u12
>>> d = u12.U12()
>>> d.eAnalogIn(0)
{'overVoltage': 0,
 'idnum': 0,
 'voltage': 1.42578125
}
>>> d.close()

From there, check the Examples/ directory, especially the workingWithModbus.py
file to get started.
