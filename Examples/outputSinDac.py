"""
Demonstrates how to output a sine wave using DAC0. Since we have to do it all
in software, there are limitations on how fast we can update the DAC. Update
intervals faster than 5 ms may give weird results because of the large
percentage of missed updates.

When changing the update interval and frequency, consider how your values effect
the waveform. A slow update interval coupled with a fast frequency can result in
strange behavior. Try to keep the period (1/frequency) much greater than update
interval.

Note: The UD-Modbus interface is deprecated.

Our Python interfaces throw exceptions when there are any issues with
device communications that need addressed. Many of our examples will
terminate immediately when an exception is thrown. The onus is on the API
user to address the cause of any exceptions thrown, and add exception
handling when appropriate. We create our own exception classes that are
derived from the built-in Python Exception class and can be caught as such.
For more information, see the implementation in our source code and the
Python standard documentation.
